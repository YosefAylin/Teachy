# Folder Structure Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### Configuration
- Moved `SecurityConfig.java` from root package to `config` package
- Moved `AdminInitializer.java` from root package to `config` package

### DTOs
- Moved `RegisterDto.java` from `controller` package to `dto/request` package

### Controllers
Reorganized controllers by domain/feature:
- Created `AuthController` in `controller/auth` package for authentication-related endpoints
- Moved `HomeController` to `controller/home` package
- Moved `HomeRedirectController` to `controller/home` package
- Moved `AdminController` to `controller/admin` package
- Moved `StudentController` to `controller/student` package
- Moved `TeacherController` to `controller/teacher` package

### Test Structure
- Fixed case sensitivity issue with test packages
- Created proper test directory structure to match main structure
- Updated package declarations in test files

## Improvements

1. **Better Organization**: Code is now organized by feature/domain, making it easier to locate related functionality.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between configuration, controllers, DTOs, and other components.

3. **Standard Compliance**: Structure now follows Spring Boot best practices and conventions.

4. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend as the application grows.

5. **Readability**: Package names clearly indicate the purpose of contained classes.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Imports**: Any remaining classes that import from old package locations need to be updated.

2. **Fix Test Issues**: Address test failures related to application context loading.

3. **Documentation**: Update any documentation that references the old package structure.

4. **Remove Old Files**: Once everything is working correctly, remove the original files that were moved to new locations.

## Documentation Updates

As part of the ongoing documentation improvements, the following documentation has been added:

1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Added Javadoc comments to key classes like `UserServiceImpl` and `User`
   - Created package-info.java files for main packages (controller, service, model)
   - Documented complex logic and business rules

2. **Project Documentation**:
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive project information
   - Created API-DOCUMENTATION.md with detailed endpoint documentation
   - Created ARCHITECTURE.md explaining the system design
   - Created USER-GUIDE.md with instructions for all user roles

3. **Documentation Process**:
   - Created DOCUMENTATION-UPDATE-TEMPLATE.md for tracking documentation changes
   - Established DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md with standards and best practices

These documentation improvements ensure that the project is well-documented at all levels, from code-level details to high-level architecture and user instructions.
